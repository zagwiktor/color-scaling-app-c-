# ColorScalingApp

Project written for the "Assembler Languages" course.
The application allows loading an image and adjusting the intensity of color channels (R, G, B) using sliders, as well as selecting the number of threads to perform the image modification process. After adjusting the new values (R, G, B), the user has the option to save the modified image.

The aim of the project was to investigate how the number of threads affects the execution time of the photo modification process and an attempt to accelerate the program's performance by adding a dynamic library that contains an assembly language function reflecting the image modification algorithm from the C# dynamic library.
